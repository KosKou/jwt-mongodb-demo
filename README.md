The cycle will be explained into the JwtServiceImpl.class using both tokenFilters

To make this run please try url's that fill the roles and users first, without the tokens and security.
[
  "url" : {
      "/fillRoles",
      "/addUsers"
  }
]

If there's no users created yet u will not generate a token so there's no much things that someone could do without the init line.

Have fun, happy coding!
